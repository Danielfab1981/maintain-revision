# Maintain Revision

![Main workflow](https://github.com/anttikivi/maintain-revision/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg)

Maintain Revision is a GitHub Actions action for keeping the remote development version numbers of [Obliging Ode](https://github.com/anttikivi/unsung-anthem), [Unsung Anthem](https://github.com/anttikivi/unsung-anthem), and their related projects up to date. It reads and sets the version for the current run of the projects on GitHub Actions by reading the last development version number from S3 and uploads the new development version to the same S3 bucket.

## Usage

You can use the current development version of this action by adding the following step to your workflow.

```yml
uses: anttikivi/maintain-revision@develop
```

See the [documentation for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsuses) for more information on how to use actions in your workflows.

Please note that there are no released versions of Maintain Revision yet.
